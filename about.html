        <p>It all began when my father died when I was eighteen years old. Things were rough, and I had no choice but to drop out of school to help my mother and younger brother. Early in my career, I had to start working. Working at a coffee shop, selling newspapers, and working at a gas station all at the same time provided me with a wealth of expertise in a short period, allowing me to acquire a consulting position. I've worked with top companies like HP, Cisco, Akamai, and GE, and I feel one of the things that makes me unique from my peers as a consultant is my ability to see problems.</p>
        <p>When I met our Chairman, Mrs. Uma Anupkumar, and our COO, Neha Anush, both of whom aspired to run their own Company, things began to shift for me. We all agreed on one thing: there are a lot of companies out there that can help businesses handle their difficulties. The issue is that most companies are unaware that they have a problem, and we were able to identify them. The idea for aNumak & Company as a Management Consulting Firm with one of the best functional knowledge, Objective Opinion, and On-Demand Brains was born then. </p>
